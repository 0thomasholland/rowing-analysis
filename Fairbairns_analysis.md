# Analysis of the Fairbairn's Race Data

NB - correction, Elasped time should be in "sec" not "mins"

## Summary

- An increase in rate through the race allowed the crew to maintain a consistent speed
- Final increase of rate at the end was rewarded with an increased speed
- The boat check was correlated with both the time through course and the rate
- At the same speed values, there are higher check values later into the race compared to the earlier portions

## Boat speed through time

This initial graph shows that, ignoring the start sequence, the increase in rate through the race allowed the crew to maintain a consistent speed throughout the race. There were periods of lower speeds (below 4.5), however it is thought that these are resulting from reduced speeds in corners.

It also apears that the final increase in pace resulted in a successful increase of pace through to the finish.


## Boat Check

It apears that the boat check was correlated with both the time through course and the rate, however it is hard to determin which of these are the causal factor.

An interesting note is that the high check values all originate within the start sequence, and ignoring these values the check value only increased by 10% through the race.

There seems to be a loose positive correlation between the speed of the boat and the boat check. Also, it apears that for the same speed values, there are higher check values later into the race compared to the earlier portions.

## Distance per stroke

It apears that the distance per stroke leveled off during the piece, with small burst of fluctuation on the smaller scale.

It also apears that the rate did not affect the distance per stroke dramatically above 33 spm, however that trend shown in the first image is also consistant with time and rate, so it may again be a factor of fatuige.
