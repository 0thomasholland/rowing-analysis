# Rowing Analysis Python File


This is a simple script that reads a CSV output from a CoxOrb and outputs some graphics for analysis under the "output" folder.


I have run the data from the 2022 Fairbairns race for the Jesus M1 crew as a test, and have written some quick analysis under the "Fairbairns_analysis.md" file, the graphs output can be seen under the "fairbairns_output" folder.
